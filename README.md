Python-based time-series data analysis on wind speed and direction data
# Wind Data Analysis using Python

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing one-year wind data recorded at 10-minute intervals using Python. 
The objective is to extract meaningful insights from large time-series datasets through data processing,
statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features
- Wind speed frequency distribution using custom binning
- Wind direction frequency analysis
- Shear factor calculation across different heights
- Data visualization using Python libraries

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
